> Insights into Time Series Data: Construction of a FastAPI Server for Prognos-tication and Data Visualization

In todayâ€™s fast-paced, data-driven world, businesses and organizations often face inefficiencies and wasted resources. Issues such as overstocking, un-derutilized energy systems, and inaccurate demand forecasts for public plac-es can lead to increased costs and operational setbacks. Is it possible to de-velop a web server with integrated AI models that allows businesses and or-ganizations to plan more effectively, predict trends more accurately, and re-duce inefficiencies and wasted resources in a convenient and fast way?

This thesis explores the integration of AI models in a web server to implement a web server that can automatically predict time series data. The web server will have two main functions, one is to automatically process and train data, and the other is to predict data and display the predicted data in a dynamic form.

Finally, a web server that can automatically predict and visualize time series data was implemented. This thesis details the construction of the web server, the integration of models, the challenges encountered, and suggestions for improvement. The web server provides a practical and scalable solution for industries requiring time-sensitive insights, such as energy management, re-tail, and logistics.
